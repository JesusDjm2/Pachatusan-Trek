                        Peru is one of the most sought after and diverse destinations in <strong>South America</strong>,
                        it offers you not only incredible <strong>landscapes</strong>, but also unforgettable
                        experiences, without forgetting its famous and acclaimed cuisine, recognized worldwide. As in
                        any trip, it is necessary that before visiting Peru, you take into account some factors and
                        recommendations to avoid any situation that may make you uncomfortable.<br><br>

                        For these and many more reasons, here we will help you with the main recommendations, tips and
                        suggestions to make your visit to Peru, in addition to an informed and safe trip, a comforting
                        and unforgettable experience.

                        <h2>Documentation necessary to travel to Peru</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If you are thinking about the type of documentation necessary to enter Peru, we tell you that
                        you do not have to worry, because to travel to Peru you only need a lot of energy, interest and
                        of course, your passport. To enter the country, most American and European citizens do NOT need
                        to apply for a tourist visa, since it is granted to them immediately upon entering the country
                        and allows you to travel freely for approximately a maximum of 90 days. However, to avoid
                        inconvenience, it is good to have a backup of your return ticket home.<br><br>

                        For a longer stay and for other reasons (business, work, study, etc.) it is necessary to
                        previously request a visa from the Peruvian consulates. If you come from countries like
                        Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay, you can enter with
                        your citizenship card, without the need to present your passport. Remember that it is
                        recommended that your passport be valid for at least 6 months after your return date from Peru.
                    </p>
                    <i>
                        Important note: Keep your documents safe. While you enjoy your trip through Peru, have with you
                        a copy of your passport or identification and make sure to leave your original documents very
                        well protected in your hotel or place of accommodation.

                        <h2>What languages are spoken in Peru?</h2>

                    <p>
                        In Peru there are 47 original or indigenous languages and they are spoken by around 4 million
                        people, and of all the native languages, <strong>Quechua</strong> is the most popular native
                        language and the second most used is <strong>Aymara</strong>, although in the past there were
                        around 100 indigenous languages These have been disappearing over the years. The vast majority
                        of native languages are found in the Amazon.<br><br>

                        Peru's main language is Spanish, which is spread and schooled at the national level and is known
                        as Castilian. This came to the Andean country with the arrival of the Spanish and remained the

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        To enjoy your trip through Peru without setbacks, we recommend you change your money, the
                        official currency and that is handled in this country is the <strong>"Nuevo Sol"</strong>. It is
                        true that in some establishments they accept US dollars or euros, but the best advice we give
                        you is that when you arrive at the airport in Peru, change part of your money to the local
                        currency, since it is easier to change dollars in exchange houses. , than to change euros.
                        Especially if you go to untouristed areas, it is complicated.<br><br>

                        Regarding credit/debit cards, some places (currently most) in Peru accept international credit
                        and debit cards (Visa, American Express, MasterCard, among others). However, a very important
                        piece of advice is that if you want to buy handicrafts, souvenirs in a local market, buy in
                        small shops, take a taxi or eat in a small typical restaurant, we recommend you always have
                        soles in cash on hand, this way you will avoid a bad time.

                        some are recommended. You need some vaccines in some cases, for example, if you are going to
                        enter the country from Angola, Brazil, Congo or Uganda, it is advisable to present your yellow
                        fever vaccination certificate. Now, if your trip includes visiting the Peruvian Amazon, our
                        recommendation is that you receive this vaccine at least 10 days before your trip so that it can
                        be effective.<br><br>

                        If none of the situations that we mentioned is your case, you do not have to worry since, as we
                        already told you, there is no type of compulsory vaccine to enter Peru.

                    </div>
                    <h3>What is the climate in Peru?</h3>

                    <p>Here we give you an idea of the climate in each region of Peru as basic data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Climate on the Peruvian Coast:</strong> North Coast: Summer temperatures range
                            between 29°C
                            (84°F) and 35°C (95°F). This season, includes the months of November to April, and is
                            known to be rainy. Between the months of May to October, the temperature drops a bit and
                            the rains end. The climate ranges from 19°C (66°F) to 28°C (82°F).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>South and Central Coast:</strong> The summer months in this region extend from
                            October to
                            March and have temperatures between 19°C (66°F) and 28°C (82°F), slightly cooler than in
                            the northern region. During the winter, the temperature can reach a minimum of 14°C
                            (57°F) and a maximum of 18°C (64°F) with constant fog.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The climate in the Peruvian Sierra:</strong> In the Andean region, the sunny days
                            occur
                            during the months of October to March, as well as the rain. The temperature in this area
                            is influenced by height and geography, for this reason, the weather during this time can
                            range between 19°C (66°F) and 28°C (82°F). Winter, which runs from April to September,
                            has temperatures from 14°C (57°F) to 18°C (64°F).<br>
                            And something to keep in mind is that, during the night, the temperature in this region
                            can drop as low as 2°C (35°F).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Weather in the Peruvian Jungle (Amazon):</strong> If you visit this region, you will
                            find a humid climate that ranges between 17°C (62°F) and 35°C (95°F). The rains are also
                            present in this area, however, during the months of May to August they decrease
                            considerably.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What is the best time to travel to Peru?</h3>

                    <p>Actually, this question can vary a lot, because it will depend entirely on the area of ​​Peru
                        that you are going to visit, so you can find the best season. For example, if you want to visit
                        the coast and the Peruvian beaches, generally the weather throughout the year is quite good,
                        since it is balanced without reaching extremes, that is, it is not too hot or too cold.<br><br>

                        But we suggest that the ideal months to visit these areas are between December, January,
                        February and March. The temperature is more moderate, it is even high.<br><br>

                        But for example if you go inland, the mountains, like Cusco or Machu Picchu, the rainy season is
                        not the most advisable, it runs from November to March approximately. It is much more advisable
                        to go in the dry season from April to mid-November.<br><br>

                        But to clarify that, in the rainy season, it's not exactly raining all the time, but there are
                        quite strong downpours that last a few minutes or last a little longer. In these situations, the
                        best thing we can recommend is that you shelter from the rain, and wait for it to stop before
                        continuing your activities. We advise you to bring a rain poncho with you, which will be very
                        useful to cope with the weather.
