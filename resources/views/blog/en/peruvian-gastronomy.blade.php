                        The richness of its lands and its cultural diversity make Peru a country of exquisite and varied
                        gastronomy. Each city has a typical dish with a unique flavor. Thousands of products from the

                        created an infinite offer for the palate. <br><br>
                        Peruvian gastronomy is a celebration of Peru. A country with an ancient tradition and a
                        promising future that does not lose sight of its roots and where the art of good eating stands
                        out among its inhabitants as one of the most distinctive signs of its identity. Do you want to
                        know why Peruvian gastronomy is a trend? Next, we will explain the reasons!

                        <h2>Origin of Peruvian gastronomy</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Did you know that Peruvian gastronomy is made up of foods and flavors from the four continents?
                        That's right, its originality lies in its ability to incorporate the influence of different
                        times and cultures. Here we tell you how the unique flavor of our country was born and why it is
                        so valuable to celebrate and preserve our culinary traditions.<br><br>

                        The origin of Peruvian food dates back to pre-Inca cultures and the Incas. The central Peruvian
                        Andes was the largest center for the domestication of plants in the ancient world, with native
                        species such as corn, tubers with two thousand five hundred varieties of potatoes, many sweet
                        potatoes, yucca or manioc, oca, maca, grasses quinoa, kiwicha or amaranth, cañihua. And an
                        infinity of fruits and aromatic herbs such as chocha, yuyo, salt, and chili.<br><br>

                        Perhaps you did not know it, but as we mentioned above, the Peruvian natives had already
                        domesticated hundreds of varieties of potatoes before the Spanish arrived. And this tuber is one
                        of the most important contributions of the Incas to the entire world. You just have to remember
                        how many countries have used the potato in their gastronomy. Impressive, right? In addition, the
                        diet of the Incas was carried out by meats such as alpaca and guinea pigs.

                        variety called lemon. The vine (from which pisco originates) and the wines are also part of this
                        period. In addition, with the arrival of the Spanish, they brought with them African slaves who
                        influenced the creation of two of the best dishes in Peru, such as Anticuchos and Tacu Tacu.

                        part thanks to this assimilation of new techniques and new ingredients, old preparations survive
                        today, especially in the most rural areas of the country.<br><br>It is the wealth that we have
                        not stopped talking about, the heritage that gives Peru its luster and turned Lima, within the

                    </div>

                    <p>After seeing some of their awards, let's review what makes Peruvian cuisine so attractive:</p>

                    <h3> It is the best example of fusion food</h3>

                    <p> Foreign recipes in which original ingredients are substituted for native ones or upside down,
                        Peruvian recipes in which some ingredients are added or changed for traditional products from
                        other cultures. <br><br>

                        Among the foreign cultures that stand out in this colorful and delicious fusion, we find the
                        Chinese, Italian, Japanese, African, Spanish, and French cultures. Some examples of Peruvian
                        dishes that are the result of fusion:

                        rice and fish, with typical Peruvian products, such as peppers and grains. Some dishes of
                        Peruvian cuisine acclaimed in the world belong to the famous Nikkei fusion, for example:

                        We can say, then, that Peruvian food has centuries of history and development and is a
                        fundamental part of the Inca heritage, but that at the same time it was enriched by Spanish,
                        African, French, and Chinese-Cantonese culture.<br> <br>

                        All this has made Peru a power in gastronomic tourism that you cannot miss.</p>

                    </p>

                    <h5><strong>La sierra: powerful and nutritious dishes</strong></h5>

                    <p> It covers the area of the Cordillera de Los Andes and crosses the country from north to south.
                        Here, visitors find excellent cuisine with flavors and colors that make each presentation
                        unique. Here are some examples:

                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Fried Trout:</strong> this fish, with a high content of minerals and vitamins, is
                            an essential part of the diet of the populations of the Peruvian highlands. In restaurants,
                            this fish is served with potatoes, salads, and different local sauces.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Lamb's Head Broth: </strong> This broth has great flavor and is a favorite with
                            locals and visitors alike. It is boiled for hours, after cleaning and chopping the head of

                            the guts of the cows, and it also has beef in pieces and different vegetables.</li>
                        <li> <strong> Cuy chactado:</strong> this preparation consists of frying the Cuy, a typical
                            animal of Peruvian gastronomy until it obtains a texture that is as soft inside as it is
                            crispy on the outside. It is also accompanied by sauces, French fries, and salad.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5><strong>The coast: fresh and simple recipes.</strong></h5>

                    <p> Although each coastal city has its gastronomy, fish, yellow chili, red chili, shellfish,
                        potatoes, and rice are present in most of their recipes. Without a doubt, the most popular dish
                        is ceviche, a delicacy of Peruvian gastronomy with a simple preparation: basically, it consists
                        of pieces of fresh fish that are left to marinate in a container with lemon juice for
                        approximately 20 minutes, at which red onion, coriander or cilantro, chili, and salt are added
                        to give it intense aromas and flavors. Other typical dishes of the coast are:

                            spices.</li>
                        <li> <strong> Sautéed noodles: </strong> is a dish that has a Chinese influence, along with the
                            best of
                            Peruvian cuisine. It has beef, usually, loins cut into strips, yellow pepper, cumin, and
                            other ingredients that give it a Creole touch.</li>
                        <li> <strong> Fish jelly:</strong> is one of the simplest dishes to prepare in Peruvian cuisine.
                            These

                        <li> <strong> Green rice with seafood:</strong> it is similar to traditional rice with seafood
                            with the
                            difference that a green variant is used, a color that it obtains previously by being
                            cooked with tomatoes, coriander, and other vegetables.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Thanks to the quantity and variety of fruits that are produced in Peru, it is truly enviable. The
                        innovation of specialists has led to exotic combinations that make it impossible to know exactly

                    <h3>Chicha de Jora and Chicha Morada:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Corn represents a basic and historical input, which is even used for the preparation of drinks
                        such as the traditional chicha de Jora and the Creole chicha Morada. Chicha de Jora is made from
                        fermented corn with fruit and was used by ancient Peruvians in special ceremonies, while chicha
                        Morada is made from corn boiled with fruit and mixed with sugar and lemon to taste.

                    <h3>Pisco and pisco sour</h3>

                    <p>
                        Pisco, the national drink of Peru, is a grape brandy that emerged in Ica in colonial times after
                        the Spanish introduced the first vineyards in Peru.<br><br>

                        The word pisco is part of the name of a large number of Peruvian towns, regions, and hamlets,
                        such as Piscohuasi or Piscopampa. Furthermore, in the mid-16th century, the Spanish began to use
                        the name pisco to designate a river, a town, and a port south of Lima (see Pisco - Paracas). The
                        first news in Peru about the production of grape brandy dates back to the beginning of the 17th
                        century. <br>Currently, to preserve the denomination of origin, it is only produced on the coast
                        (up to 2000 meters above sea level) in the departments of Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua, and
                        Tacna. <br><br>

                        Pisco can be enjoyed pure or in a long list of cocktails such as the chilcano, the algarrobina,
                        or the pisco sour. The latter is the most emblematic.
