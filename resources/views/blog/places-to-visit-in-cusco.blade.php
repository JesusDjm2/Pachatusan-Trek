                        <p> This list of <strong> the best places to visit in Cusco </strong> will help you prepare a
                            route through one of the most historic and beautiful cities in Latin America, which we are
                            sure will not disappoint. Located on a slope of the Andes mountain range, Cusco was the
                            capital of the Inca Empire and one of the most important cities in the Spanish colonial era.
                            Declared a World Heritage Site, it still preserves remains of Inca temples and constructions
                            in the foundations of numerous colonial buildings in which this mixture of two cultures can
                            be observed while walking through its cobbled streets and squares, visiting the most
                            important temples and churches, as well as when try its delicious gastronomy accompanied by
                            a pisco sour. In addition, the city is perfect as a base to visit some of the great jewels
                            of Peru such as the Sacred Valley, the Mountain of the 7 colors and Machu Picchu. </p>

                    <div id="plaza" style="padding-top:70px">
                        <h5>1. Plaza de Armas</h5>
                        <p>
                            The Plaza de Armas is the heart of the historic center and one of the most important places
                            to visit in Cusco. Formerly, this square was a swamp that the Incas dried to make it the
                            center of administration for the entire Empire, but with the arrival of the Spanish,
                            numerous buildings and churches were built around the square, on top of the Inca temples and
                            palaces. Today the square is full of tourist restaurants and large chains such as McDonald’s
                            or Starbucks, travel agencies and souvenir shops, which for us have taken away the charm of

                            <br> Two of the most interesting places that you can visit in the square are the Cathedral
                            of Cusco and the Church of the Company of Jesus. The Cathedral with a mix of Baroque, Gothic
                            and Plateresque styles has several wonders inside such as the chapels, the main altar and
                            the sacristy. Next to the Cathedral, there is the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús, one of
                            the most beautiful baroque churches in Peru where, in addition to observing its impressive
                            façade, it is worth entering to see the main altar, the 4 cedar altars and the golden
                            pulpit.

                        <p>San Blas, located in the historic center, is the most beautiful and charming neighborhood to
                            see in Cusco. Strolling through the narrow and steep cobblestone streets, seeing the old
                            colonial houses or looking for some original souvenir in one of the shops and craft
                            workshops, are some of the best things to do in Cuzco.
                            <br> Among its most interesting places is the Church of San Blas, the oldest in the city
                            built on an Inca temple that is worth going inside to see its fantastic carved wooden
                            pulpit.
                            <br> Also in this neighborhood, being in the upper part of the city, you will have good
                            views of the city. It is recommended to finish a route through Cuzco in a day returning to

                        <p>Qorikancha was a temple built by the Incas dedicated to the Sun god that over time expanded
                            and beautified until it became the most important place of worship in the Inca Empire. One
                            of the most outstanding elements that are preserved from the temple are the large blocks of
                            solid rock that were joined without any mortar, to form large walls. These walls that were
                            covered with gold foil delimited several temples within Qorikancha such as the Sun, the Moon
                            and the Stars.
                            <br> With the arrival of the Spanish, the Convent of Santo Domingo was built on top of
                            Qorikancha, destroying the upper part of the Inca temple.

                            Located about 40 minutes walk north of the historic center, there are the ruins of the
                            Sacsayhuamán fortress, another of the essential places to visit in Cusco. This complex began
                            to be built in the 15th century by order of Pachacutec, one of the most important Incas that
                            the Empire had. And although currently only a part of the old Sacsayhuamán is preserved, you
                            can still see the incredible walls of large stone blocks forming 3 overlapping platforms.
                            Keep in mind that in the complex you can walk through the different platforms using the
                            stairs and doors made of stone such as the fantastic Puerta del Sol and on various stones of
                            the walls, which reach 400 meters in length, see various images made by the Incas .
                            <br> If you have time, we recommend doing a route that can take you one morning, first
                            visiting the Inca ruins of Tambomachay, Pukapukara, Qenqo and ending with Sacsayhuamán. To
                            do this route you can take a combi in the Plaza de Armas until you reach the last site and
                            walk down the hill visiting the rest of the temples.
                            <br> Visiting hours: every day from 07:00 to 18:00

                        <p>Hatun Rumiyoq is a stone wall (green diorite) located on the street of the same name. It must
                            have been part of the palace attributed to Inca Roca. This covers almost all of Hatun
                            Rumiyoc Street; street known worldwide because it houses the “stone of the twelve angles”,
                            famous for the perfect assembly of its 12 corners and its sides, with the stones that
                            surround it.
                            <br> This wall has overlapping colonial and republican structures, and is currently occupied
                            by the Archbishop's Palace and the Museum of Religious Art of Cusco. In this place the
                            architects had to build a kind of platform, to level the terrain, since the steep slope that
                            leads to the traditional neighborhood of San Blas begins here.
                            <br> It is located about 200 m from the Plaza de Armas of the City of Cusco, in Peru; It is
                            reached in a northeast direction by the side of the Iglesia del Triunfo; From here walk
                            straight and you will reach Hatun Rumiyoc Pedestrian Street.

                        <p>Another of the places to see in Cuzco is the Mercado de San Pedro, the oldest and best known
                            in the city. This market, also called Central Market, was built by the famous Gustav Eiffel,
                            author of the Eiffel Tower and inside you will see stalls of all kinds of typical products
                            of Peru such as passion fruit, pineapple, corn, cassava, Andean potatoes and others more
                            common in all markets. It is also a good place to buy handicrafts and try typical local
                            dishes at one of the food stalls. The Central Market of Cusco is located 5 blocks from the
                            Plaza de Armas of Cusco in a western direction near the San Pedro train station.
                            <br> The Central Market of Cusco houses a large number of food stalls, with entire sections,
                            dedicated exclusively to fruit juices and juices, snacks and prepared meals. If the weather
                            is cold, one of the best options is head broth (from lamb), but if, as usual, the sun
                            shines, you can enjoy a delicious ceviche (raw fish marinated in lemon juice).
                            <br> Hidden among the corridors of the Mercado de San Pedro (in the fruit section) you can
                            find stalls with exotic products brought from the Amazon, tinctures of herbs, and
                            sebum-based ointments from certain animals. Here you can buy coca leaves and prepare your
                            own infusion; Coca tea is one of the best natural remedies to combat altitude sickness.
                            There is a row dedicated to chocolate, here you can find a mixture of delicious chocolate,
                            coca leaves and mint (very delicious). It is not unusual that people who come from nearby
                            provinces come in typical costumes, carrying their babies on their backs in typical
                            blankets, from which it seems that they are going to fall, but you will see that this is not
                            the case.

                    <p>In addition to Sacsayhuamán, there are three other Inca archaeological sites that deserve to
                        be among the essential places to visit in Cusco. The first is Tambomachay, dedicated to the
                        cult of water and located 8 kilometers from Cusco, which highlights a beautiful natural
                        environment where an Inca hydraulic system consisting of sources, channels and aqueducts was
                        located.
                        <br> A 5-minute walk from Tambomachay is Pukapukara, known as the Red Fort. In these ruins
                        you can see the different rooms and walls of the old fortress, which could be used as a
                        hunting lodge, guard post or a stopping place for the royal procession.
                        <br> Following the road in the direction of Sacsayhuamán you will arrive, in an hour on
                        foot, to Qenqo, a religious complex where you can see the remains of various Inca buildings
                        such as an amphitheater, two columns with astronomical functions, a canal and an underground
                        room . Qenqo is located one kilometer from Sacsayhuamán and also very close to the Cristo
                        Blanco, an 8-meter statue from which you can take the way down to the city, with fantastic
                        views of the city of Cusco.
                        <br> To save money we advise you to book the specific tourist ticket for the Cusco area that
                        includes all these ruins and the tourist attractions of the city. Keep in mind that although
                        it is recommended to do this walking tour of the landscapes, you can take a combi that
                        brings you closer to this site.

                    <div id="sacredvalley" style="padding-top:70px"><h5> 8. The Sacred Valley of the Incas </h5>
                    <p> The magical Sacred Valley of the Incas, located 15 kilometers from Cusco, is one of the most
                        impressive places to visit in Peru. In this Andes valley that passes several rivers, you
                        will find archaeological sites of the ancient Incas, indigenous and colonial towns and
                        landscapes that will leave you speechless.
                        <br> This valley was highly appreciated by the Incas for its good conditions for agriculture
                        in which, taking advantage of the geography, they created a system of terraces to cultivate
                        their precious corn. Among the essential places to see in the Sacred Valley are:
                        <br> Pisac: The impressive Inca ruins situated on a hill, the cultivation terraces and the
                        handicraft market are enough reasons to visit Pisac. Ollantaytambo: This is one of the
                        masterpieces of Inca architecture in which an enormous complex of several floors built on
                        two mountains stands out, which had defensive, religious and administrative functions.
                        Moray: In this place you can see perfect circular terraces that would have been used by the
                        Incas to do experiments with different crops. Salineras de Maras: Thousands of small pools
                        filled with water form this old salt mine that will leave a postcard image on your retina.
                        Chinchero: This indigenous town is one of the most beautiful in the Sacred Valley. Do not
                        miss the square located on what was an Inca palace and the stalls to buy crafts that mount
                        in the surroundings.
                        <br> To save money we advise you to book the specific tourist ticket for the Cusco area that
                        includes all these ruins and the tourist attractions of the city. Keep in mind that although
                        it is recommended to do this walking tour of the landscapes, you can take a combi that
                        brings you closer to this site.

                    <p>
                        Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Incas, located just over 100 kilometers from Cusco, is
                        considered one of the seven wonders of the world as well as one of the most important places
                        to visit in Cusco. This ancient Inca city, which was hidden between the mountains and the
                        vegetation until the explorer Hiram Bingham discovered it in 1911, stands out for its
                        15th-century ruins such as the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, the Main Temple,
                        the Temple of the Condor and the Three Windows Room.
                        <br> To get to know the history of this ancient city better and not miss any interesting
                        place, it is advisable to do part of the visit with a guide. To visit the city of Machu
                        Picchu and climb the Huaynapicchu you must reserve the entrance several months in advance,
                        as you have a limited number of daily visitors. To get to Machu Picchu by public transport,
                        you can take a train in Cuzco or Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes, where buses leave every
                        hour to take you to the entrance of the archaeological site.
                        <br> Another option is to book this day trip that includes transportation, hotel pickup,
                        entrance, and a guide in Spanish during your visit to Machu Picchu. That said, we have to
                        highlight that the most magical way to get to Machu Picchu is by walking the 40 kilometers
                        of the Inca Trail, which have made it one of the best things to do in Peru. This 4-day
                        excursion through paths with ancient stone steps, valleys and mountains with dream
                        landscapes, will take you to this wonder of the world. You can shorten part of the journey
                        by booking this two-day tour. Visiting hours: every day from 6 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

                    <p>
                        Another of the best excursions and places to visit in Cusco is the Rainbow Mountain also
                        called the Mountain of the Seven Colors. Located more than 5000 meters high in the Andes, it
                        presents one of the most incredible geological phenomena on earth, which have made it one of
                        the best-known places in the area in a few years. This explosion of colors is the product of
                        the combination of different minerals that give the sensation that a rainbow fell from the
                        sky on the mountain, when viewed from afar. Keep in mind that the best time to see the hues
                        clearly is in July and August, the dry season.
                        <br> The best and most comfortable way to get to the Rainbow Mountain is to book this
                        excursion from Cusco with a guide in Spanish or this 4-day tour that includes Machu Picchu,
                        both will take you to one of the most impressive places to visit in Cusco. Keep in mind that
                        the journey to the point where the trekking begins is about three hours and although the
                        views of the mountain and the path are impressive, the trek of about 3 hours to the
                        viewpoint of the Rainbow is quite demanding. It is advisable to bring warm clothes and coca
                        leaves to overcome altitude sickness.
                        <br> Although this place is far from the usual tourist routes that focus on knowing the
                        Sacred Valley, it is becoming very fashionable and more and more people visit it, so if you
                        are going to take the excursion, it is worth booking in advance. .
